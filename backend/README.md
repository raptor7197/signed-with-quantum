##  Overview Of the project 

This project implements quantum-resistant digital signatures using the Dilithium2 algorithm from the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library. It provides functionality to sign images and verify their authenticity, protecting against tampering even in a post-quantum computing era.

##  Features of this Project 

- **Quantum-Safe Signatures**: Uses Dilithium2 algorithm for post-quantum security
- **Image Signing**: Sign JPEG images with quantum-resistant signatures
- **Signature Verification**: Verify image authenticity and detect tampering
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Modern Python**: Built with Python 3.13 and managed with uv

##  Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.13 or higher
- Git (for cloning dependencies)
- C compiler (for building liboqs-python):
  - **Linux**: gcc or clang
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools or MinGW
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools

## Setup

To run this project, you will need to have the `liboqs` library compiled and installed on your system. You can find instructions on how to do this in the [official `liboqs` GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs).

Please be aware that you might encounter some issues while compiling the library.

You will also need to install the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing uv

uv is a fast Python package installer and resolver. Install it using one of the following methods:

#### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

#### Alternative installation via pip:
```bash
pip install uv
```

#### Via Homebrew (macOS/Linux):
```bash
brew install uv
```

After installation, verify uv is installed:
```bash
uv --version
```

##  Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raptor7197/signed-with-quantum.git
cd signed-with-quantum
```

### 2. Install Python 3.13

The project requires Python 3.13. uv will automatically handle the Python version if you have it installed. Otherwise:

#### Using uv to install Python:
```bash
uv python install 3.13
```

#### Manual installation:
- **Linux**: Use your package manager or pyenv
- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **macOS**: Use Homebrew (`brew install python@3.13`) or download from python.org

### 3. Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

uv will automatically create a virtual environment and install all dependencies:

```bash
# This single command creates .venv and installs all dependencies
uv sync
```

This command will:
- Create a `.venv` directory with a Python 3.13 virtual environment
- Install all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
- Clone and build `liboqs-python` from GitHub
- Generate/update the `uv.lock` file

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional)

While uv can run commands directly in the virtual environment, you can also activate it manually:

#### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

#### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

```

##  Usage

### Running Scripts with uv

You can run Python scripts directly with uv without activating the virtual environment:

```bash
# Run the image signing example
uv run python main.py

# Run the test implementation
uv run python test_implementation.py

# Run the test implementation with Image
uv run python test_implementation_with_image.py

```

### Running Scripts with Activated Environment

If you've activated the virtual environment:

```bash
# Run the image signing example
python main.py

# Run the test implementation
python test_implementation.py
```

### Example: Sign and Verify an Image

```python
from PIL import Image
import io
import oqs

# Load an image
img = Image.open("images/test_image_2.jpeg")
buffer = io.BytesIO()
img.save(buffer, format="JPEG")
image_bytes = buffer.getvalue()

# Create signature
with oqs.Signature("Dilithium2") as signer:
    public_key = signer.generate_keypair()
    signature = signer.sign(image_bytes)
    
    # Verify signature
    valid = signer.verify(image_bytes, signature, public_key)
    print("Signature valid?", valid)
```

##  Development

### Adding Dependencies

To add new dependencies to the project:

```bash
# Add a production dependency
uv add package-name

# Add a development dependency
uv add --dev package-name

# Add a specific version
uv add "package-name>=1.0.0"
```

### Updating Dependencies

```bash
# Update all dependencies to their latest compatible versions
uv sync --upgrade

# Update a specific package
uv add --upgrade package-name
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests with uv
uv run python -m pytest

# Or with activated environment
python -m pytest
```

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues that might occur 

#### 1. liboqs-python Build Fails

If the liboqs-python build fails, ensure you have the required build tools:
This Library has to be compiled from scratch from the Github repo so...
This has been Included in the Dockerfile.
 ```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-python.git
cd oqs-python
pip install .

 ```


**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install gcc cmake make             # Fedora
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake             # Arch
```

**Windows:**
Install Visual Studio Build Tools or MinGW-w64

**macOS:**
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### 2. Python 3.13 Not Found

If uv can't find Python 3.13:
```bash
# Install Python 3.13 with uv
uv python install 3.13

# Or specify the Python path explicitly
uv venv --python /path/to/python3.13
```

#### 3. Permission Errors on Windows

Run PowerShell as Administrator or adjust execution policy:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### 4. Virtual Environment Not Activating

Ensure the virtual environment exists:
```bash
# Recreate the virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.13

# Then sync dependencies
uv sync
```

### Cleaning and Reinstalling

If you encounter persistent issues:

```bash
# Remove virtual environment and lock file
rm -rf .venv uv.lock  # Linux/macOS
rmdir /s .venv && del uv.lock  # Windows CMD

# Reinstall everything
uv sync
```

##  Dependencies
The project uses the following main dependencies:

- **liboqs-python**: Post-quantum cryptography library (installed from GitHub, not PyPI)
- **oqs** (>=0.10.2): Open Quantum Safe Python bindings for post-quantum algorithms
- **Pillow** (>=11.3.0): Python Imaging Library for image processing

Other dependencies may be specified in `pyproject.toml` as needed for development or testing. 


### After Deploying the Backend you have to add the backend address field in the app and if you are running it locally (recommended) you should have the ip address with the port number 


## Running the Application

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Connecting to the Frontend

After building the application, you will need to link the backend to the frontend by providing the backend URL to the frontend application.
Click on the settings Icon in the application and it will lead you to the backend link input box.

## Deployment

A Dockerfile is provided for containerizing the application. However, there might be some issues with the library compilation and the Dockerfile when deploying the application.
